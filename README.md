Description
What it does
This project is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. The game allows a player to guess letters in a randomly chosen word within a limited number of attempts.

Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Python programming concepts such as classes, functions, and loops to create an interactive game.

What I learned
Through this project, I learned how to:

Implement classes and methods in Python.
Utilize control flow statements for game logic.
Manage program state through class attributes.


Certainly! A well-documented README can greatly enhance the quality and usability of your project. Below is a sample README template that includes all the sections you mentioned:
