What it does:
This project is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game, Hangman. The game allows a player to guess letters in a randomly chosen word within a limited number of attempts.

Aim of the Project:
The aim of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Python programming concepts such as classes, functions, and loops to create an interactive game.

Through this project, I learned how to:
Implement classes and methods in Python.
Utilize control flow statements for game logic.
Manage program state through class attributes.
