# Description
# Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of Python programming concepts such as classes, functions, and loops to create an interactive game.

# What I learned
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Implement classes and methods in Python.
- Utilize control flow statements for game logic.
- Manage program state through class attributes.

# Installation Instructions
1. Clone this GitHub repository.
`git clone https://github.com/Mohammad-Furqan-Portfolio/hangman-game.git`

2. Navigate into the project directory.
`cd hangman-game`

3. Run the program.
`python hangman.py`

# Usage Instructions
Once you run the program, follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters in the randomly selected word. You will have 5 lives to guess the word correctly.

# File Structure

README.md - Documentation

# Development Journey
- The project was initially developed in milestones, each focusing on specific functionalities.
- Later, all milestones were combined into a single file (hangman.py) for simplicity and ease of use.
