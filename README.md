# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Project Description
What it does
This project is a simple Python game that allows users to guess a word selected randomly from a list of fruits. The user has to guess one letter at a time until they can figure out the entire word.

Aim of the project
The main aim of this project is to demonstrate the fundamentals of Python programming including loops, conditionals, and functions.

What I learned
Through this project, I gained a better understanding of Python's control structures and built-in functions. I also learned how to modularize my code by splitting it into functions.
